This phylogeny shows the evolutionary relationshpis of SAR-CoV-2 viruses from the ongoing novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. The very shown above is focused on a specific region of the USA, with surrounding sequences selected to reflect national and global diversity most closely matching the focal dataset.

You can see the full SARS-CoV-2 tree [on the Nextstrain website](https://nextstrain.org/ncov).

As always, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding estimates of specific transmission dates and in reconstruction of geographic spread. Please be aware that specific inferred transmission patterns are only a hypothesis.
